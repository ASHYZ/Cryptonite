i)	Caas (WEB EXPLOITATION)

I used the link given on the website Cowsay As a Service :
https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}
and here I took message as ‘caas’ .  But as it didn’t lead me to anywhere so I tried giving ‘flag’ as the message which again didn’t help much, So I searched up more about Cowsay  ( as I am completely new to it ) and ended up using the following link as my next step 
https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/flag ;ls
  which directed me to a page

I tried gaining knowledge of every term on the page shown and learnt that ‘falg.txt’ should lead me to the flag I wanted so I used 
https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/flag ;cat falg.txt
  which led me to the following page and I got my answer

ii) Most Cookies ( WEB EXPLOITATION)

 I tried doing this challenge but couldn't solve it.
 As far as I understood this question was that key is one of the cookie name . I tried to study flask functions and learnt that flask_unsign can be used to proceed further as it helps to fetch and decode session cookies of a Flask application by guessing secret keys.
 But I couldn't procced further this.
